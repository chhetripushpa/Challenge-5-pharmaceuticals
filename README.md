# Pymaceuticals Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of drug treatment data for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using data from Pymaceuticals, Inc.'s animal study. The study examined 249 mice with SCC tumors who received different drug treatments over 45 days.

## Key Findings
1. Treatment Effectiveness:
   * Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective drug regimens, showing lower final tumor volumes 
   * These treatments demonstrated more consistent results with smaller ranges in their box plots

2. Size and Treatment Relationship:
   * Strong positive correlation (r = 0.84) between mouse weight and tumor volume
   * This indicates larger mice tend to have larger tumors, even with treatment

3. Treatment Consistency:
   * Most drug regimens showed few outliers in their results
   * Infubinol showed one significant outlier in the lower range
   * Treatments with lower median tumor volumes also showed lower variability
